## Team

* [Candy Pink](candy-pink): Alberto, Íñigo, Santiago, David

## Organization

* 9/10/2015. 19:45-21:45. All members of the group meet in a bar and comment what we want our service to do. In addition to the proposals seen in class, we all think together more things our service to do. These ideas are collected in a paper document.

* 19/10/2015. 19:00-20:30. All members of the group meet in 0.1 laboratory. We decide exactly all the things we want our service to do, and we realize an approximation of the marks ("bare pass", "notable" and "outstanding") of each section we have decided. We set a meeting with the professor Francisco J. López Pellicer to comment the sections and marks we have decided. A summary is realized in a paper document.

* 20/10/2015. 19:15-19:30. All members of the group do a meeting with the professor Francisco J. López Pellicer in his office. We comment him our service proposals and we come to the conclusion to collect all proposals in a document with the asked format. We set another meeting with him before the agreement of our contract.

* 23/10/2015. 16:30-18:00. A document with the asked format is realized. We collect all our objectives (what we want about this work), and our services with their respectives description of the expected marks. The written document is not the last document (this means, it's not our contract), but a draft to be confirmed with the professors before the signature of it. The document is sent to the professor Francisco J. López Pellicer.

* 25/10/2015. 18:00-19:30. We get back the draft with some indications made by Francisco J. López Pellicer with changes we should make. We improve our document with the suggested changes and we return it to Francisco J. López Pellicer. The next step is to wait for our turn to set our project agreement. It is supposed to realize it during this week or the beginning of the next one.

* 03/11/2015 19:10-21:00. After meeting with the professor Francisco J. López Pellicer and discuss the project agreement, two members of the team (Alberto Álvarez Aldea and Iñigo Gascón Royo) sign the final project contract. The other two members (Santiago Gil Begué and David Nicuesa Aranda) must sign the project during this week.

* 04/11/2015 15:50-16:30. Santiago Gil Begué and David Nicuesa Aranda meet with the professor Francisco J. López Pellicer in order to get the project contract signed by all member of the group. It is also discussed how to begin the project (a initial design of it and how our components communicate themselves), and which Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) to use.

* 04/11/2015 15:50-16:30. Santiago Gil Begué and David Nicuesa Aranda meet with the professor Francisco J. López Pellicer in order to get the project contract signed by all member of the group. It is also discussed how to begin the project (a initial design of it and how our components communicate themselves), and which Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) to use.

* 19/11/2015 13:00-14:00 . All members of the group meet with the professor F. Javier Zarazaga-Soria in order to get the component's diagram of the service fixed. It is confirmed by F. Javier Zarazaga-Soria, and the group can begin to develop the service, and all the communications between the components of it.

* 05/12/2015 12:00-22:00. David Nicuesa, Alberto Álvarez and Santiago Gil begin to implement the service. Work is realized together in three different computers, and supported on Github to get the work of all members synchronized. Each member specializes in one functionality of the proyect, but everyone helps when someone has big problems to keep on his part.
 
* 06/12/2015 9:00-21:00. All membes of the group keep on developing the service. David Nicuesa, Alberto Álvarez and Santiago Gil work together and Iñigo Gascón works via Skype. Again, each member specializes in one functionality of the proyect, but everyone helps when someone has big problems to keep on his part.

#Award
