[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/UrlShortener2015.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/UrlShortener2015)

This is the shared repository for the project developed in this course. Go to the [wiki](wiki) to start your project.

## Projects

* [Common](common) is the project that provides a minimum set of shared features.
* [Demo](demo) is the template project and the sandbox for solving blocking issues.

## Teams

[TO BE COMPLETED]

## Starting procedure

* The team leader forks this repository
* Each team member forks the fork of the respective team leader
* Import your own fork into eclipse. You must import the common project, the demo project and your project. For example, if your project is _BangladeshGreen_ you must import `UrlShortener2015.common`, `UrlShortener2015.demo` and `UrlShortener2015.bangladeshGreen`. Other projects are optional.
* Create the folder `src\main\java` in your project.
* Copy the contents of `src\main\java` from `UrlShortener205.demo` into your project.
* Rename the package `urlshortener2015.demo` to your color. For example if your project is _BangladeshGreen_ you must rename it to `urlshortener2015.bangladeshgreen`.
* Test that your program run using command line (`gradle run`) or within eclipse (either as Java application or as Gradle application).
* Do `$ curl -v -d "url=http://www.unizar.es/" -X POST http://localhost:8080/link` and check that appears a line in the console that contains `u.d.web.UrlShortenerControllerWithLogs`

Now you can start to add new functionality to your project.

* Periodically, each team member must __pull__ from GitHub to fetch and merge changes from remote repositories (your team changes or changes in the original repository).

## Organization

* 11/10/2015. 19:45-21:45. All members of the group meet in a bar and comment what we want our service to do. In addition to the proposals seen in class, we all think together more things our service to do. This ideas are collected in a paper document.

* 19/10/2015. 19:00-20:30. All members of the group meet in 0.1 laboratory. We decide exactly all the things we want our service to do, and we realize and approximation of the marks ("bare pass", "notable" and "outstanding") of each section we have decided. We set a meeting with the professor Francisco J. LÃ³pez Pellicer to comment the sections and marks we have decided. A summary is realized in a paper document.
